# microgpt Ecosystem - Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Original microgpt.py preserved
- [x] Enhanced model.py with modern features (GELU, dropout, LayerNorm, multi-layer)
- [x] Trainer with Adam optimizer, LR scheduling, gradient clipping
- [x] Data loading and tokenization
- [x] Configuration management (YAML/JSON)
- [x] Checkpoint management (save/load)
- [x] Logging and metrics tracking

## Phase 2: User Interfaces ✅
- [x] CLI interface (train/generate/eval)
- [x] Web interface (Flask)
- [x] REST API server (OpenAI-compatible)
- [x] Interactive chat interface

## Phase 3: Advanced Features ✅
- [x] Advanced sampling (beam search, contrastive, top-p, top-k)
- [x] Quantization (INT8/INT4)
- [x] Model export (JSON, pickle, numpy, torch, ONNX)
- [x] Distributed training (data parallel, pipeline parallel)
- [x] Benchmarking tools
- [x] Pretraining infrastructure
- [x] Finetuning with freezing/unfreezing
- [x] Interpretability tools (attention, neurons, probing)

## Phase 4: Tokenizers ✅
